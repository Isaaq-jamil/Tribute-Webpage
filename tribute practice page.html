<p id="early life"><strong>Muhammad Ali (Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr) was born on the 17th January 1942 and sadly passed away on the 3rd June 2016. He was an American professional boxer and activist. Nicknamed "The Greatest", he is regarded as one of the most significant sports figures of the 20th century, and is frequently ranked as the greatest heavyweight boxer of all time. Born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, he began training as an amateur boxer at age 12. At 18, he won a gold medal in the light heavyweight division at the 1960 Summer Olympics and turned professional later that year. He became a Muslim after 1961. He won the world heavyweight championship from Sonny Liston in a major upset on February 25, 1964, at age 22. Also that year, he formally changed his name to Muhammad Ali. In 1966, Ali refused to be drafted into the military owing to his religious beliefs and ethical opposition to the Vietnam War and was found guilty of draft evasion and stripped of his boxing titles.

<p id="Joe Frazier Fight"><strong>Ali and Frazier's first fight on March 8th 1971, was nicknamed the "Fight of the Century", because of the tremendous excitement surrounding a bout between two undefeated fighters. Before the fight Frazier called Ali, "Cassius Clay", this angered Ali. Ali lost his first professional fight by an unanimous decision.

<p id="Conversion To Islam"><strong>Ali said that he first heard of Islam when he was fighting in the Golden Gloves tournament in Chicago in 1959. In 1962, Clay met Malcolm X, who soon became his spiritual and political mentor. Ali attributed his conversion to mainstream Sunni Islam to Warith Deen Muhammad, who assumed leadership of the Nation of Islam upon the death of his father Elijah Muhammad. Ali had gone on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in 1972. After retiring from boxing, Ali became a student of the Quran and a devout Muslim. He also developed an interest in Sufism.
